Katuv is a tool for defining and transforming Embedded Ruby DSLs (EDSLs). It
provides a simple facility to define DSL components and their connections.

## Naming

The word [katúv](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91#Hebrew)
(Hebrew: 'כָּתוּב') means 'written.' I chose the name as it seemed appropriate with
this tools purpose (parsing and transforming embedded Ruby DSLs). I had thought
to use `Mikra` -- but decided that would be inappropriate as it is used to
[refer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikra) to the Jewish Bible, commonly known
as the Tanakh. I like interesting names, as they give me an opportunity to tell
people about interesting things, so I hope you found this interesting.
